#What has changed
The contact form is now no longer a pop up page.  I felt due to the size of the new contact form it was best placed in its own separate page. This would allow us in future to modify the page to make the website more helpful, by forcing the user down this route of a page, we could introduce a FAQ Section, perhaps even introduce a contact directory. This means the possibility of spending less time responding to repetitive enquires.  I felt a pop up would not be best placed to offer these future design and business considerations. 

Despite saying the pop up offering less possibilities, it would still be possible in future to produce a quick form if required for convenience.  

I was able to make the code more modular, I did this by cutting the form up into sections and storing the components individually, this could mean in future just selecting the contact sections required to produce a pop up. Originally the code was all stuck together, making alterations, fixes or additions cumbersome. It introduced the possibility of breaking its operation or introducing bugs because the code is quite similar. Therefore the separation has allowed us the decreased the possibility of breaking its operation, decreased time required to introduce, fix or make changes to the required sections while allowing the possibility of modularity later on in the product life.  

I have also taken the liberty of moving the values used to populate drop down boxes contents in to there own variables, again this allows for cleaner code to maintain and to also introduce new departments or titles.  As a side note, it would be possible to change the department section into something less specific such as a classification of what the enquiry entails.  The modularity of the code would allow this to be done very quickly.
